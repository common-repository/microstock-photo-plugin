Some Web hosts block the purchase and download of photos read the troubleshooting below

== Troubleshooting ==

1. If you can not login with your credentials in the plugin settings then there is a minimal chance that your host has some extra security settings enabled. We recommend to enable the `Test mode` before you actually spend money buying stock photos.
2. Go into the plugin settings and scroll down to the `Settings` area
3. Enable `Test mode` to test the connection to the stock agencies
4. You can now test the connection and if you download it will only download a comp file which is free of charge
